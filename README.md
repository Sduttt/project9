# Assignment 9 
## Full Stack Javascript Web Development Course by [iNeuron](https://ineuron.ai/)

This website is created with HTML and CSS only. It is not fully mobile responsive till now, though I have tried to give it a little responsiveness. I will update this project very soon to make it mobile responsive. It took me almost 5 to 6 hours to complete this project. All the images and logos were provided by iNeuron team.
